# Part 2 of the `Airline Networks` assignment


## Assignment description
Use your own implementation of the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between
the ’S’ character and the ’T’ character in the three files here: 
https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2021springmal/tree/main/data/astar  
In the txt files:  
’S’ represents the start node, 
’T’ represents the target node,  
’W’ represents an impassable wall node,  
’*’ represents a normal passable node.  

The maps are always rectangular, with the same number of characters
on each line.
