# Part 1 of the `Airline Networks` assignment

Different algorithm implementations for solving airline connectivity...

## Assignment description

Implement a directed graph for flight routes using the data files here: 
https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2021springmal/tree/main/data/airlines 

The graph representation should be such that it
is both efficient in terms of memory use and time taken to do the following
operations:
1. Find if an airport can be reached from another using only a single airline
   company. You should compare Breath-First and Depth-First approaches.
2. Finding shortest path (distance) from one location to another (Dijkstraâ€™s
   algirithm)
3. Finding shortest path (time) from one location to another, assuming that
   each transfer takes one hour.
4. Finding airline that has widest coverage (Minimum Spanning Tree)
5. Defend the choice of datastructure with regard of time and space complexity
   (big O).
