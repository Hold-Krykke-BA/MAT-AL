# Assignment 3 - Sorting Shakespeare

This is the first of five mini projects - mandatory assignments.
#### In groups:
We want Shakespeares complete works, sorted by word. Meaning that “to be or not to be, that is the question” would be sorted as: “be be is not or question that the to to”.
You can find the complete works [here](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2020spring-alg/tree/master/data). You shall in groups create a program, that can
* read any textfile (as the above) into an array or List2. The content should be sanitized:
  * All words should be lower case
  * No punktuations - strip commas, full stops, etc.
* sort the array using different sorting algorithms:
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Heap Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Sorting using a Trie
* be extended with other sorting algorithms in the future.
* messure and log the time used for each algorithm as a function of the file size in words.  
The solution accompanied with a description in a README.md file should be uploaded (pushed) to a git repository.
